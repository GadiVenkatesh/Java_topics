Streams represents sequence of elements on operations to perfrom computations.

Stream API allows developers to perform filter/map/reduce-like operations on collections of objects. It enables functional-style operations on streams of elements, allowing for concise and expressive code.

Here are some key characteristics of Java Streams:

Declarative Nature: Streams allow you to express what you want to accomplish, rather than how to accomplish it. This makes your code more readable and less error-prone.

Lazy Evaluation: Stream operations are typically lazy, meaning they don't perform any processing until a terminal operation is invoked. This allows for efficient use of resources, especially when dealing with large datasets.

Functional Operations: Streams support a variety of functional-style operations such as filter, map, reduce, collect, forEach, flatMap, etc. These operations can be chained together to form complex data processing pipelines.

Parallel Processing: Streams can leverage parallelism to improve performance when processing large datasets. Parallel streams divide the data into multiple chunks and process them concurrently on multiple threads, utilizing multicore processors effectively.

Here's a simple example demonstrating the usage of streams:

java
Copy code
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> fruits = Arrays.asList("apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry");

        // Filter fruits starting with letter 'a', then convert to uppercase, and print
        fruits.stream()
              .filter(fruit -> fruit.startsWith("a"))
              .map(String::toUpperCase)
              .forEach(System.out::println);
    }
}
