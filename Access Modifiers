1)What are access modifiers in Java?
Access modifiers are keywords that determine the accessibility or visibility of classes, methods, and variables in Java.

2)What are the different types of access modifiers in Java?
Java has four types of access modifiers: public, protected, default (package-private), and private.

3)Explain the public access modifier.
The public access modifier makes a class, method, or variable accessible from any other class in the same package or from any other package.

4)Explain the protected access modifier.
The protected access modifier makes a class, method, or variable accessible within the same package or by subclasses (even if they are in a different package).

5)Explain the default (no modifier) access modifier.
The default access modifier (also known as package-private) makes a class, method, or variable accessible only within the same package.

6)Explain the private access modifier.
The private access modifier makes a method or variable accessible only within the same class. It is the most restrictive access level.

7)What is the default access modifier for class members (methods and variables) if no access modifier is specified?
The default access modifier for class members is package-private, meaning they are accessible within the same package but not from outside the package.

8)Can you provide an example where you would use each type of access modifier?
This question tests the candidate's understanding of when to use each access modifier based on the desired level of visibility and encapsulation.

9)What is the access level of a class if no access modifier is specified?
If no access modifier is specified for a class, the default access level is package-private, meaning the class is accessible only within the same package.

10)Why is encapsulation important in object-oriented programming?
This question explores the importance of encapsulation in terms of data hiding, abstraction, and maintaining the integrity of class implementations.
