1.Mutable Objects
These objects can be modified after their creation like ArrayList,StringBuilder and hashmap.

StringBuilder s = "Hello"
s.append("World!")
System.out.println("s");

2.Immutable Objects
These objects cannot be modified after creation. Actually modification results creation of new objects.
String s = "Hello";
s= s.concat("World!");
System.out.println("s");
